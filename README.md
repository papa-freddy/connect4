This project was the final assignment of an introductory Python course taken during my first year in university. 

I, along with 2 other friends, built a basic AI that could play Connect4 against a human player. 

The moves that are allowed in the game are quite simple: you can either place a token in a column, or you could pop a column by removing the lowest token in the column and letting the tokens above drop to 1 row 
below them.

Descriptions of what each function does can be found in the full Python code.
